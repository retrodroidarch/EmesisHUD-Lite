EmesisHUD Lite v1.0.1
After weeks of polishing, renaming files, fixing structures, and testing in matches, this build is stable enough to share. All core HUD .res files have been corrected and validated.
Changes & Reworks
- Renamed and case‑matched all HUD files (Valve’s HUD system is case‑sensitive)
- Fixed broken panels and brace mismatches
- Cleaned up internal block names and structures for consistency
- Validated scoreboard, health, ammo, kill feed, and team status in live matches
- Checked layering (zpos) and alignment across HUD elements
- Removed silent errors caused by incorrect naming conventions
Installation
- Download the release package
- Place the folder in:
tf/custom/EmesisHUD_Lite
- (Optional) Add -dev to your TF2 launch options for testing
- Use hud_reloadscheme in console to refresh after edits
Notes
- This is a lightweight, modular HUD — focused on stability and clarity.
- Feedback, screenshots, and bug reports are welcome.
